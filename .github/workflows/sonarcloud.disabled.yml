# SonarCloud CI workflow disabled. This file contains the previous workflow implementation
# and was renamed to avoid duplicate Sonar runs while the CI pipeline was streamlined.
# To re-enable: rename this file to sonarcloud.yml and ensure repository secrets are set.

# Previous workflow removed for brevity. See docs/sonar.md for instructions to enable Sonar in CI.
