# Traders Mirror

Traders Mirror is a small Trading-Journal application built with React + TypeScript following Onion Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

See the documentation in the `docs/` folder for architecture diagrams and details.

To render the documentation locally (with PlantUML diagrams) use Asciidoctor with the diagram plugin:

```bash
# from repo root
cd docs
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-diagram architecture.adoc
```

Open the generated HTML in the `docs` directory.
